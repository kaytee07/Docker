## Docker Practice
This repo will just be me practicing how to create docker images, start containers from docker images, push docker images to docker hub, pull docker images from docker hub and start containers from them

# The bigger picture
I'm trying to create script that pulls docker images from docker hub and run them on my remote server. I'll use fabric to run this scipt that start the containers on the remote server. in the end the IP address and port will be sent back so a user can have access to their application.
